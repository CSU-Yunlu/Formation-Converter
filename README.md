# Robocup Formation 

If your RoboCup team is using the `v3` format of formation configuration files, when you open a file with the newest `fedit2` and save it, it will become `json` format and the `type` of your player role will all be set to `Unknow` just like:

```json
"role" : [
    {
       "number" : 1,
       "name" : "Goalie",
       "type" : "Unknown",
       "side" : "C",
       "pair" : 0
    },
    {
       "number" : 2,
       "name" : "CenterBack",
       "type" : "Unknown",
       "side" : "C",
       "pair" : 3
    },
```
